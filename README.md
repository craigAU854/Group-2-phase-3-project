**The CLI follows best practices to enhance user experience**

Separation of scripted elements from object-oriented code.
Validation of user input to ensure data integrity.
Detailed prompts and messages to guide users throughout the execution.
Utilization of external libraries (e.g., Click) to minimize project-specific code.
